      <description>A little moan to start with&amp;hellip; I owned a mid 2009 MacBook Pro, I never used it for presenting stuff to others but I actually bought a remote control for it. The computer cost me a lot of money, it was top end stuff when it was bought. The remote control cost me the money as well. I also have a copy of Keynote. It also cost me money. A while ago I&amp;rsquo;ve switched to a new MacBook, the Retina one, top end as well.</description>
