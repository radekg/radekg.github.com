      <description>what is Firecracker Firecracker is a virtualization technology for creating and managing secure, multi-tenant services suited for container-like and serverless scenarios. Firecracker workloads run in virtual machines, not containers. Unlike containers, they benefit from extra isolation properties provided by the hardware virtualization. Similar to containers, Firecracker VMs—microVMs—are lightweight and fast to boot. Like containers, they can be treated like cattle. They combine the flexibility of containers and security of virtual machines.</description>

      <description>Dockerfiles are awesome There is so much software out there packaged as Docker images. Operating systems, SQL and NoSQL databases, reverse proxies, compilers, everything. Safe to say, most of that software available as Docker containers is built from the common file format - the Dockerfile. Dockerfiles are awesome. They are recipes for getting a bit of software functional.
how have I been building Firecracker VMMs so far So far, all of my VMMs were built from Docker images using the following steps:</description>

      <title>Launching Alpine Linux on Firecracker like a boss</title>

      <description>The quest to launch an ETCD cluster on Firecracker starts here.
In this post, I&amp;rsquo;m describing how I&amp;rsquo;ve built my initial Alpine 3.13 VMM with OpenSSH and a dedicated sudoer user. In AWS, when one launches a Ubuntu instance, one can access it via ssh ubuntu@&amp;lt;address&amp;gt;, a CentOS VM is ssh centos@&amp;lt;address&amp;gt;. At the end of this write up, I&amp;rsquo;ll have ssh alpine@&amp;lt;address&amp;gt;. This VMM will have access to the outside world so I can install additional software and even ping the BBC!</description>

      <description>Keycloak is an open source Identity and Access Management System developed as a JBoss community project under the stewardship of Red Hat. Keycloak makes it is easy to secure apps and services written in many technologies using a large number client libraries.
Out of the box, we get things like Single Sign-On, Identity Brokering and Social Login, User Federation and Authorization Services.
With little to no code, we can give users of our apps the ability to sign in with Identity Providers like GitHub, Twitter or Google.</description>

      <description>About two weeks ago, Virdata released a set of patches for Apache Spark enabling Spark to work on Mesos with Docker bridge networking. We are using these in production for our multi tenant Spark environment.
SPARK-11638: Spark patches All patches for all components described below are available in Spark JIRA. We&amp;rsquo;ve released patches for all versions of Spark available at the time of creating them - from 1.4.0 to 1.5.2. We have also released patches for Akka 2.</description>
