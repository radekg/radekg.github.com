      <description>obligatory Keycloak mention Keycloak is awesome because it provides almost everything an organization of almost any size might ever need when it comes to topics like OpenID, SSO, federation or authorization services.
But Keycloak is a monolith, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t do things the cloud native way1. There&amp;rsquo;s quite a few running modes one needs to fully understand how to operate: standalone, standalone clustered, domain clustered mode, cross data center replication. All very powerful but to many, pretty unapproachable.</description>

      <description>As the number of applications and websites in the organization grows, the developer will inevitably receive a request to implement Single Sign-On. Single Sign-On (SSO for short) is an authentication scheme allowing the user to log in with a single set of credentials and share the session across multiple, independent, potentially unrelated systems.
The savvy developer will roll out Keycloak, enable Standard Flow client, maybe enable some of the social login options, like GitHub, Google or Facebook and call it a day.</description>

      <description>Keycloak is an open source Identity and Access Management System developed as a JBoss community project under the stewardship of Red Hat. Keycloak makes it is easy to secure apps and services written in many technologies using a large number client libraries.
Out of the box, we get things like Single Sign-On, Identity Brokering and Social Login, User Federation and Authorization Services.
With little to no code, we can give users of our apps the ability to sign in with Identity Providers like GitHub, Twitter or Google.</description>
