      <description>Today I have looked at creating my own bridge networks for Firecracker VMMs. I already used CNI setups when evaluating the HashiCorp Nomad firecracker task driver1. Back then I incorrectly stated that Firecracker depends on certain CNI plugins. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t, it can take advantage of any CNI setup as long as the tc-redirect-tap is in the chained plugins.
The Nomad task driver had some issues, briefly:
 every now and then, oddly, the task would never shut the VMM down and the only way to make the VMM gow down was to sudo kill nomad I tried updating the task driver to latest SDK version but I was not able to upgrade the Firecracker dependency past a specific commit, any version after that specific commit makes the VMM come up, the network setup to be there but the VMM is not reachable, really, really weird issue - reported it here  So today, I took a different route.</description>
