      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s good to know how to set up Firecracker VM by hand but that&amp;rsquo;s definitely suboptimal long term. So today I am looking at setting up Firecracker with CNI plugins. Firecracker needs four CNI plugins to operate: ptp, firewall, host-local and tc-redirect-tap. First three come from the CNI plugins1 repository, the last one comes from AWS Labs tc-redirect-tap2 repository.

As something coming from AWS and powering AWS Lambda, my original perception was that it&amp;rsquo;s not easy to set up and use. However, this write from Julia Evans2 proved me wrong. So, as I have recently picked up a used Dell R720 with decent amount of RAM and CPUs, it was time to take these two for a spin together.</description>
